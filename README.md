# bookstore

This is a small Java Spring Boot project that I made as an exercise for learning the basics of Spring Boot, creating a few RESTful endpoints connected to a very simple MySQL database:

- GET, POST and PUT for `books` table
- GET, POST and PUT for `authors` table
- GET, POST and PUT for `publishers` table

The `database.sql` file is the SQL script (generated by MySQL Workbench's forward engineering) that can be run on MySQL to build the database I designed for this project. The corresponding diagram can be found in `database.jpg`.

Run the project with `./mvnw spring-boot:run` after having edited the `application.properties` file with your local configuration.
